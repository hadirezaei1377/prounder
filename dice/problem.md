Do this project for me in Gulang language

In this project, we want to check whether the probability of different dice numbers are really equal or not
First, generate the numbers one to six in a suitable and high number, for example 10,000 times, and store them in a list

Then print the results and say how many times each of the dice numbers was repeated and how many times each of them was repeated
